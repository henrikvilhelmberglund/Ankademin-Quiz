## Hey there

Have you ever missed the traditional classroom experience where you can quickly sketch something on a chalkboard?

Just press 'b' or click on the &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-pen-square"></i>&nbsp; button to open and close your chalkboard. {class="fragment" data-fragment-index=0 data-audio-advance="false"}


<form name="theme" class="fragment" data-fragment-index=0 style="font-size: 20px">
    Select appearance: 
    <input type="radio" name="theme" value="chalkboard" onclick="changeTheme(this);" checked autocomplete="off"> Chalkboard</input>
    <input type="radio" name="theme" value="whiteboard" onclick="changeTheme(this);" autocomplete="off"> Whiteboard</input>
</form>

*   Click the left mouse button to write on the chalkboard

Make notes on slides
--------------------

Did you notice the    button?

By pressing 'c' or clicking the button you can start and stop the notes taking mode allowing you to write comments and notes directly on the slide.

After you are done please advance to the next slide and click the play button again.

---

Default settings
----------------

By default, a drawing cannot be edited after navigating away from the slide.

Please check out [Github](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/chalkboard) for a documentation of the settings.

Playback
--------

The plugin records all drawings and you can download them in a JSON-file by pressing 'd'.

The pre-recorded drawings can be added to the slideshow for playback.

### JSON-file

If you are not an artist, you can also create a JSON-file based on an SVG image.
